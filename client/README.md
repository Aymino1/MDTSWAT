CLIENT - Vite + React
---------------------
Steps to run:
1. cd client
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
The app expects the API at http://localhost:4000 by default. You can set VITE_API_URL in a .env file in the client folder.

Notes:
- Replace public/los_santos_placeholder.txt with a real image named 'los_santos.jpg' if you want an image in the header.
- The admin seeded on server side: username 'admin', password 'admin123' (change immediately in production)
